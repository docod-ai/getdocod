# Changelog

All notable changes to the DOCOD bundle. Versions follow semver and match the
`specVersion` in the spec files: patch = fixes, minor = new agents/commands/
migrations (backward-safe), major = contract changes that move user state —
and those only ship together with their migration (install.sh step 2b).

## [1.4.1] — 2026-07-27

Fixed: rebless key resolver, fourth field-found key shape — scope-prefixed
parenthesized keys ("project (docs/product/prd.md)") now unwrap before
normalization. Basename choked on the closing paren and declared identified
sources non-repinnable.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-07-24

Added: Claude Code plugin packaging (.claude-plugin/ + /docod:setup-docod);
the `handoff` skill (session-only context by reference, never duplicating
artifacts); skill enrichment learned from the field — seams and the
tautological-test anti-pattern in testing-guidelines, feedback-loop-first as
the spine of bugfix, tracer bullets in vertical-slicing.

Added: touched-doc-means-mapped-radius, mechanically. Re-approving an artifact
AMENDED after approval now requires either --impact <impact-file> (recorded in
the frontmatter) or --no-impact "<reason>" (a recorded waiver); the runtime
refuses otherwise. Born on record: an ad-hoc impact sweep left 4 task files
stale (2 merged) and spent effort on a non-ripple; the owned transitive
closure caught both. First approvals untouched; cosmetic bulk has rebless.

Changed: `/docod:loop` is now the dispatch of ONE task through the non-human
stretch (build → external verify → QA → fix rounds → diff review), not a batch
runner across tasks — parallel tasks are parallel dispatches. Same stop
conditions (hand-backs, upstream root cause, repeated failing verdict, anything
needing approval); it never approves.

Docs: README gains the plugin install path and a "Where DOCOD sits" section
(skill pack vs process framework vs raw agent — what each gives, what it
cannot); ARCHITECTURE documents the impact-approval gate and the
attribution-mismatch warning.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-07-23

Added: the upstream-root-cause gate. QA now classifies every bug's root cause
by layer (this task's code vs a named upstream artifact); an UPSTREAM root
cause triggers impact-analysis and blocks forward-patching. The executor is
forbidden to patch around an approved contract/design ("additive,
non-breaking" self-classification is the fork). The loop stops on it. Found in
the field: a code fix for a contract omission created a code↔design
contradiction that no hash can detect, because neither side was edited — they
just stopped agreeing.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-07-23

Fixed: `verify` false-positive storm — the undeclared-ADR-link guard sliced
path-shaped keys to "docs" and warned on every declared ADR. It now extracts
the ADR number from any key shape. When everything warns, nothing warns.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-07-23

Added: the execution-start stamp. The task-executor's first write on a task is
`execution: {started: {by, at}}` in its frontmatter (a fact, not a progress
claim; `co_writer` extended accordingly), and the report's kanban shows a
stamped-but-unticked task as in progress. Also exposes abandoned tasks:
started long ago, zero ticks.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-23

Added: `/docod:loop`, delegated run under a human mandate — chains
build → external verify → QA → fix rounds → diff review per task, stopping
only at hand-backs, repeated failing verdicts, blocked requires, or anything
needing approval (it never approves). Supervised delegation, not autopilot.

Changed: `task-executor` now reads `cicd-guidelines`, checks the project's
isolation rule before its first edit (no rule = a flagged gap, never a license
to edit the mainline), and ticks each subtask the moment it verifies — the
checkboxes are the only progress signal the method reads. `project-management`
now counts capacity AI-natively: governance bandwidth (approvals, reviews,
inquiry answers), not typing hands; velocity is measured through the gates.

Docs: README and ARCHITECTURE updated accordingly.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-23

First public release. 28 agents (27 producers + tech-lead counsel), 37
registered artifacts, 12 skills, 4 rule templates, 2 adapters, and the
governance runtime (`docod.mjs`): status · start · continue · approve · ws ·
report · verify · rebless. Pure-bash installer, node ≥18 runtime with vendored
YAML, zero installation. Battle-tested on three real projects before this tag;
the model's pending/resolved history lives in `migration.yaml`.
